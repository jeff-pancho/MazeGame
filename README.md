# MazeGame
A game where the user tries to escape three mazes with varying difficulties. Written in Python 2.7.1.

I developed this game for a bonus assignment I chose to do over the winter break for Computer Programming 12 in highschool.

# How to play
First, you are given the choice of choosing an `easy`, `medium`, or `hard` maze. After choosing a maze, you can start playing!

When you start the game, these symbols will appear:

`O`: The player

`X`: The walls

`.`: The empty space you can walk on

If you are stuck, type in `help` for a list of commands that you can do. The commands are:

`n`, `s`, `e`, `w`: Commands to move north, south, east, or west.

`die`: End the game. In order to play again, you need to reload the program.


# How to run
An online version of this game can be found [here](https://repl.it/@Panchouchou/MazeGame).

Alternatively, download or clone the repo onto your computer and run it through the terminal:
```
python main.py
```
**NOTE:** This program was written in Python 2.7.1; therefore, the program will only run in that version.

# Extra

This program has a lot of comments because of one of the requirements of my assignment (document everything).

This program was written before I learned about classes, so the use of dictionaries may be unnecessary here.
